## Instructions

The next instructions applies to NVIDIA Rapids ver. 0.9

Running NVIDIA Rapids distributed workloads requires a DASK-cuda cluster. Setting up a DASK-cuda cluster in SUMMIT
needs three components running: dask-cuda-scheduler, dask-cuda-workers and python calls in your python script to
connect to the DASK-cuda cluster.
